# Webcrawler Project

This project is a web scraping tool built using Scrapy, a powerful web crawling and scraping framework for Python. It extracts data from a specific website and generates an HTML file with the scraped information presented in a professional format.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install Scrapy, which can be done via pip:

```
pip install scrapy
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Markmahugu/webcrawler.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd webcrawler
```

### Usage

1. Run the Scrapy spider to scrape data from the target website:

```
scrapy crawl mycrawler -o output.json
```

2. Once the spider has finished scraping, run the `generate_html.py` script to generate the HTML file:

```
python generate_html.py
```

3. Open `output.html` in a web browser to view the scraped data in a professional HTML format.
